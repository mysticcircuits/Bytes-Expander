# Bytes-Expander
Variable Loop Length Turing Machine Expander

A 3rd party Turing Machine expander which allows for voltage control over the loop length of the host device.  It will require 
some modifications to the host Turing Machine which have only been tested with the Turing v1, but it is hypothetically
possible to modify the v2 to do accept the expander too.  There are instructions for the v1 modifications in the instructions
folder.

For questions or help building the module check out the relevant thread on MW.
